<p>
<b><i>epilogos</i></b> is a system for the visualization and analysis of large numbers of chromatin state models.
<br>
It scales up easily to hundreds of epigenomes, provides an intuitive overview of genomic regions of interest,
<br>
and allows for precise modeling and inference of epigenomic data sets.
  
<br><br>
  
The current page is only a preview, as we're working on further applications of <b><i>epilogos</i></b>,
<br>
including, but not limited to, comparative epigenomics and prototype discovery and searching.

<b><span style="color:#f00;">UPDATE (2015/03/18):</span></b><br>
As part of the Roadmap Epigenomics Project, <b><i>epilogos</i></b> are now available for all Roadmap chromatin state models,<br>
at the <a href="http://compbio.mit.edu/roadmap" target="_blank">web portal</a> of the Roadmap project.
Thanks to Anshul Kundaje and Jin Wook Lee at Stanford for facilitating this.
